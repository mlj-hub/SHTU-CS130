For task 2, a thread can have two priorities:
1. original priority
2. donated priority

original priority is set when the thread is created and can be modifidy by calling thread_set_priority
donated priority is related to waiters of locks which are held by this thread. donated priority is the largest priority of 
the threads which are waiting for locks which are held by this thread.

In struct thread, donor_list will be the list which contains all donors. when calling thread_get_priority, it will return 
the highest priority among the thread self and its donors. when calling thread_set_priority, it will set the priority member 
in the struct thread.

When will the donated_priority be changed?
1. lock_acquire : when there is a thread trying to acquire the lock which has already been held, we need to 
add this thread into the holder's donor list and change its donated priority
2. lock_release : when a lock is released by a thread, 

When to preempt the running thread ?
1. lock acquire: when a lock is acquired, there may occur a donation and change the priority of some threads.
2. lock release: when a lock is released, the donated priority may be changed which can cause a preempt.
